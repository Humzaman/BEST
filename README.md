# Brief Estimate of Seconds Test

Chronognosis, the altered perception of passing time, is a well noted phenomenon that occurs in various neurological disorders. Currently, there is no known standardized technique for the assessment of this condition. Furthermore, experimental neuroscientists have demonstrated that time-perception underlies many other domains of brain function. In this project, I am working with researchers in the Vanderbilt University Department of Neurology to develop a simple, easy to administer assessment in the form a mobile application that will be used for both research and clinical purposes.
